### Standalone components
The components can be used without loading the whole library. Take a look at the individual files at:

# Known Issues

### Configuring icons path when importing SCSS

If you are importing .scss files in your project, the icons path needs to be configured in your project's .scss file before the Fundamental UI scss import as described below. Please note that the path variable name has to be `$fd-icons-path` in order to override the default value set in `scss/icons/icon.scss`.

```
$fd-icons-path : "../node_modules/fundamental-ui/scss/icons/"; // should be declared before the scss import

@import "../node_modules/fundamental-ui/scss/all.scss";

```
