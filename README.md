# What is SAP Fiori Fundamentals?

SAP Fiori Fundamentals is a light-weight presentation layer that can be used with your UI framework of choice (e.g. Angular, React, Vue, etc.). With Fiori Fundamentalsâ€™ library of stylesheets and HTML tags, developers can build consistent Fiori apps in any web-based technology.

#### Learn more at http://sap.github.io/fundamental/

We are also working on [Angular](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-ngx) and [React](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-react) implementations.

## Current version
````
v1.3.1
````

# Getting started
The library is modular so you can use as little or as much as you need.

#### Full library
The fully compiled, minified library is available via CDN for inclusion in your application.

```
<link href="//unpkg.com/fiori-fundamentals@1.3.1/dist/fiori-fundamentals.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

#### NPM
The compiled CSS for the full library and modules, e.g., core, layout, etc., are distributed via NPM along with the SASS source.

This gives you incredible flexibility to use individual components and enable [advanced customization](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental/wiki/Advanced-Customization) options.

````
npm install fiori-fundamentals --save
````

> NOTE: We only distribute the [fonts, icons and CSS](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental/tree/develop/dist) and [the SASS source](https://github.com/SAP/fundamental/tree/develop/scss), not the full project or HTML for specific components.

# Known Issues

### Configuring icons path when importing SCSS

If you are importing .scss files in your project, the icons path needs to be configured in your project's .scss file before the Fiori Fundamentals scss import as described below. Please note that the path variable name has to be `$fd-icons-path` in order to override the default value set in `scss/icons/icon.scss`.

```
$fd-icons-path : "../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/icons/"; // should be declared before the scss import

@import "../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/all.scss";

```
