It ensures optimal readability and space efficiency, all heights and widths are calculated from a base unit or 4.

<h2 class="docs-header-h2" id="spacing-function">Understanding Sections & Panels </h2>
<p>For common content areas such as lists, tables, cards, or forms, there is a system of sections & panels that
work together to create a consistent visual layout.</p>


<h3>Sections</h3>
Sections are the outter most containers for all content. They can contain any combination of components.
Each Section has 40px above the content area and 20px below.
All components and information contained within the content area will use their own padding and spacing.

<h3>Panels</h3>
<p>Panels are always contained inside a section and most commonly used when there are 2 panels side by side inside a section.
Card grids, however, follow their own spacing system independent of sections or panels.</p>
